## 👋 Hi, I’m Jide Akinyemi

**AI / Computer Vision Engineer | Systems-Oriented Software Developer**

I build **production-minded computer vision systems** with a strong foundation in **low-level systems, performance, and secure software design**. My work focuses on turning visual data into reliable, scalable, and verifiable products.

---

## 🔧 What I Build
- Computer vision pipelines for real-world media
- AI systems that integrate **metadata, provenance, and trust**
- Performance-aware software with clear failure modes
- Tools that scale beyond demos and notebooks

---

## 🧠 Core Expertise

### Computer Vision & AI
- OpenCV-based vision pipelines
- Image analysis and feature extraction
- ML fundamentals (training, evaluation, bias awareness)
- Dataset curation and quality control

### Systems & Performance
- Memory management and low-level debugging
- Concurrency and synchronization
- Linux / Unix development environments
- Profiling, testing, and correctness-driven design

### Software Engineering
- Python, C, C++, Java
- Modular codebases with clean interfaces
- Git-based collaboration workflows
- Maintainable, documented systems

### Security & Reliability
- Secure coding practices
- Vulnerability-aware design
- Metadata integrity and auditability
- Exposure to GRC concepts (Archer, ServiceNow)

## 📂 Selected Work
*(Representative categories – repositories evolving)*

### 🔹 Computer Vision Systems
- End-to-end image processing pipelines
- Metadata-aware visual workflows
- Early work on media authenticity and provenance

### 🔹 Systems Programming
- Custom memory management
- Synchronization primitives
- Debugging and correctness testing in low-level code

### 🔹 Tooling & Automation
- Scripted utilities for analysis and verification

## 🎯 Industry Context
I also operate a **high-end visual communications practice**, giving me direct exposure to:
- Real-world media pipelines
- Asset scale and delivery constraints
- Trust, authenticity, and lifecycle management of visual data

This perspective informs how I design AI systems that must work **outside the lab**—under time pressure, scale, and accountability.
